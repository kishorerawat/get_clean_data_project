# get_clean_data_project
Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set

This project uses "Human Activity Recognition" data captured using Smart Phones.

The project has a set of files, which are as follows

A. activity_labels.txt -> the names of the 6 activities which are observed viz. (1) standing, (2) sitting, (3) lying down, (4) walking, (5) walking downstairs and (6) walking upstairs. These activities are performed by 30 volunteers of age 19 to 48 years.

B. features.txt -> the names of the 561 data points which are recorded - either captured via the Smart phones as well as filtered and calculated using various processing techniques 

C. test and train folders -> the recorded dataset is partitioned into 2 sets  â€“ 70% of data selected for training and 30% of data selected for testing, these 2 folders contain those partitioned data separately

D. test/subject_test.txt and train/subject_train.txt -> these files contain the human volunteer number (subject) who performed the different human activities

E. test/y_test.txt and train/y_train.txt -> these files contain the index number of the activity performed (out of the 6 human activities as described in (A) above)

F. test/X_test.txt and train/X_train.txt -> these files containt the observed/calculated value for each of the 561 features

G. test/Inertial Signals and train/Inertial Signals folders -> these 2 folders contain the low-level data captured data, but these values are not used for the project analysis
